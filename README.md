## Covid + Awareness

Example of propagation coexisting processes that influence each other:

ALPHA = 0.05                # infection rate 
BETA = 0.1                  # recovery rate
GAMMA = 0.05                # mass media factor
DELTA = GAMMA + (1 - 0.3)   # mass media factor + rate of symptomatic infections
EPSILON = GAMMA             # mass media factor
