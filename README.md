# Network Diffusion â€“ Framework to Simulate Spreading Processes in Complex Networks

This repository contains code used to perform experiments and analyse results 
that have been attached to a paper submitted to 
[Big Data Mining and Analytics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8254253).

## Installation of environment
```
conda create --name bdma -y python=3.10
conda activate bdma
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install network_diffusion==0.13.0
python -m ipykernel install --user --name bdma
```

## Suspected-Infected-Removed + Unaware-Aware
Example of propagation two coexisting processes that influence each other: 
disease (following SIR model) and awarenes (following UA model). Perform 
experiments from `sir_ua.ipynb`. Details of model and results in diretory `sir_ua`.

## Multilayer Independent Cascade Model initialised with Minimum Dominating Set
Example of propagation of Independent Cascade Model in multilayer networks with
various seed selection methods. Especially a comparision of Minimum Dominating Set
(a concept from domain of netork controlability) with centrality metrics.

## Temporal Network Epistemology Model + CogSNet / Static Network
Comparison of a spreading of the Temporal Network Epistemology on two different
network models built from the same temporal edge list. Preform experiments with
`tnem_cogsnet.ipynb`. Results will be saved in `tnem_cogsnet` directory.

## Temporal Linear Threshold Model + CogSNet / Static Network
Comparison of a spreading of the Temporal Linear Threshold Model on two different
network models built from the same temporal edge list. Preform experiments with
`mltm_cogsnet.ipynb`. Results will be saved in `mltm_cogsnet` directory.

## Efficiency test
Comparison of time efficiency of models used in experiments. Execute them with 
`efficiency_test.ipynb`. Results will be saved in `efficiency_test` directory.
